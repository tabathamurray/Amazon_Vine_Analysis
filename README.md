## Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis

The goal of the writing assignment is for you to present your findings in a logical manner. As a reminder, you should use appropriate grammar and structure when writing.

For this deliverable you will write a report that summarizes the analysis performed in Deliverable 2.

For the written analysis, you will write a report that summarizes the analysis performed in Deliverable 2. The report will be written in the repository README.md and contain three sections: an overview of the analysis, results, and summary. 

**Overview of the analysis:** Explain the purpose of this analysis.

**Results:** Using bulleted lists and images as support, you should address the following questions.

* How many total reviews were there for a review that was or wasn’t written as part of the Vine program?
* How many 5 star reviews were there for a review that was or wasn’t written as part of the Vine program?
* What is the total percentage of 5 star reviews for or a review that was or wasn’t written as part of the Vine program?

**Summary:** In the summary, you should state whether there is any bias in the Vine program. They should use the results of your analysis to support your statement, and provide one additional analysis that they could do with the dataset to support your statement. 

The README.md document should be in the home directory of your repository. All links should be working, and images should be formatted and displayed where appropriate.
